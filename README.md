# Algorithm Tutorial with James
I will be using this repo to document my learning process of JavaScript and Python and hopefully it will be of use to others. I am currently migrating it to be used in the browser using React and trying to make it more interactive. I will also be adding more algorithms and data structures soon. Currently, there is only JavaScript content, however, I will also be adding a section for Python as well.
